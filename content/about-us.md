# About Us - Your Complete Padel Directory for the United States

## Welcome to America's Most Comprehensive Padel Court Directory

We're obsessed with padel. And we're pretty sure once you try it, you will be too.

Think of us as your personal padel concierge‚Äîwhether you're looking for courts in your backyard or planning a padel road trip across the country, we've got you covered. We've mapped, verified, and documented **over 120 padel clubs** and **525+ courts** across the United States, so you can spend less time searching and more time smashing.

## Our Story: From "What's Padel?" to "Where Can I Play?"

It started with a simple question that every padel player in America has asked: **"Where can I actually play this sport?"**

After falling in love with padel (it happens fast, we warned you), we realized that finding courts in the United States was like a treasure hunt‚Äîbut without the map. Some clubs were on Google, others hidden on Instagram, many weren't listed anywhere searchable. Players were asking the same questions in Facebook groups, posting "Anyone know where to play in [insert city]?" over and over again.

We thought: **This is ridiculous. In 2025, finding a padel court shouldn't be harder than actually learning to play.**

So we built this.

## What We Do

### üó∫Ô∏è We Map Every Court
From the iconic courts at Reserve Padel in Miami's Design District to the mountain-view courts at Camelback Padel Club in Phoenix, we've tracked down every padel facility across all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

### ‚úÖ We Verify Everything
We don't just copy and paste from directories. Every club in our database has been:
- **Verified from official sources** (websites, phone calls, social media)
- **Cross-referenced** with USPA directory and Playtomic
- **Updated regularly** (because clubs open, close, and expand all the time)
- **Quality checked** (we note which are active, coming soon, or temporarily closed)

### üìç We Make It Searchable
Search by state, city, indoor/outdoor, number of courts, amenities‚Äîwhatever matters to you. Planning a trip to Austin? We'll show you all 6 facilities. Looking for indoor courts in winter? Filter for climate-controlled options.

### üéæ We Keep It Current
Padel is the fastest-growing sport in the world for a reason. New clubs are opening every month. We track grand openings, expansion plans, and club updates so our directory stays fresh.

## Why We're Different

**We're Players, Not Just Data Collectors**

We understand the difference between a casual drop-in facility and a luxury club with cold plunges. We know that "coming soon" can mean anything from "opening next month" to "still in permitting." We get that some clubs are perfect for beginners while others cater to tournament players.

**We're Comprehensive**

Other directories list 20-30 clubs. We've documented 120+. Why? Because that small outdoor court in Bulverde, Texas (Pick and Paddle) deserves to be found just as much as the massive Bay Padel Treasure Island with the "world's highest ceilings."

**We're Accurate**

We caught mistakes in existing directories (hello, Hialeah vs. Doral confusion with ZIP codes). We identified platform tennis courts being mislabeled as padel. We documented which "coming soon" clubs actually opened and which went silent.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Since launching our verification project, we've:
- ‚úÖ Mapped **525+ courts** across **20+ states**
- ‚úÖ Verified **120 padel facilities** from official sources
- ‚úÖ Documented **23 multi-location chains** (from Reserve Padel to Padel Haus)
- ‚úÖ Identified **19 facilities opening soon** (with actual dates)
- ‚úÖ Cross-referenced with **USPA, Playtomic, and individual websites**
- ‚úÖ Created the **most detailed padel database** in the United States

## Our Mission

**Make padel accessible to everyone in America.**

Whether you're a curious beginner who saw padel on Instagram and wants to try it, or a seasoned player relocating to a new city, we want finding a court to be effortless.

We believe padel has the power to build communities, create friendships, and get people moving in a way that's actually fun. But none of that happens if people can't find where to play.

## What's Next?

We're not stopping at courts. We're building:
- **Comprehensive club reviews** from real players
- **Coach directories** for lessons and clinics
- **Tournament calendars** so you never miss a local competition
- **Player resources** to improve your game
- **Equipment guides** to help you find the right gear

## Join the Movement

Padel is exploding in the United States. From the Texas border (where El Paso alone has 3+ clubs) to the rooftops of Century City (Padel Up's scenic location), from Utah's first club in Salt Lake City to the NYC waterfront at Padel Haus Dumbo‚Äîthe sport is everywhere and growing fast.

**You're in the right place. Let's play.** üéæ

### Behind the Data

This directory represents hundreds of hours of verification work:
- **Web scraping** from official club websites
- **Phone verification** of addresses and hours
- **Social media research** for new openings
- **Cross-referencing** multiple data sources
- **Manual verification** of court counts and amenities

We did this because we love the sport and we believe accurate information should be free and accessible to everyone.

### Get in Touch

Found a new club we're missing? Noticed outdated information? Have a suggestion?

We're always improving, and we'd love to hear from you.

**Let's grow padel in America‚Äîtogether.** üöÄ
