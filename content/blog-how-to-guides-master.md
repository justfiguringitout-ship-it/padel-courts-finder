# GUIDE 1: How to Master Your Padel Serve

## Master the Padel Serve: Complete Technique Guide

### Why Your Serve Matters (Even Though Aces Are Rare)

The serve starts every point. Unlike tennis, you won't win points with your serve—but **you can lose them** with poor serves. Master consistency and placement, and you're already ahead of 70% of recreational players.

**Key mindset shift:**  
Tennis: Serve to win point  
Padel: **Serve to start rally advantageously**

### The Underhand Serve: Step-by-Step

**Starting Position:**
1. Stand behind service line (not baseline!)
2. Feet shoulder-width apart
3. **Sideways stance** (non-dominant shoulder toward net)
4. Ball in non-racket hand

**The Motion:**
1. **Drop ball** (let it bounce once on ground)
2. **Racket back** (small backswing, not huge)
3. Contact **below waist** (rule!)
4. Racket face **below wrist** at contact (rule!)
5. **Follow through** diagonally across body
6. Step forward after contact (momentum)

**Contact Point:**
- Height: Knee to waist level
- Position: Slightly in front of body
- **Racket angle:** Slightly open (under the ball)

### Common Serve Mistakes

❌ **Hitting too hard** (power isn't the goal)  
✅ **Fix:** 70% power maximum, focus on placement

❌ **Not getting sideways** (facing net = weak serve)  
✅ **Fix:** Turn shoulders, point non-racket shoulder at net

❌ **Contacting too high** (above waist = fault)  
✅ **Fix:** Drop ball lower, bend knees more

❌ **Aiming for aces** (rare in padel)  
✅ **Fix:** Aim for consistency and depth

❌ **No follow-through** (ball lacks control)  
✅ **Fix:** Finish across body, don't stop at contact

### Where to Aim

**Target zones:**
1. **Deep to back wall** (pushes receiver back)
2. **To the "T"** (between opponents, creates confusion)
3. **Wide to sideline** (pulls opponent off court)
4. **At backhand** (usually weaker side)

**DON'T aim:**
- ❌ Middle of service box (easy return)
- ❌ Short (gives opponent net position immediately)

### Serve Variations (Intermediate+)

**Flat serve:**
- Straight, consistent
- **Most common** for beginners
- Reliable

**Slice serve:**
- Side spin (curves away)
- More advanced
- **Good variation** once you master flat

**Topspin serve:**
- Forward spin (kicks up)
- Bounces high off back wall
- **Hardest to return** when executed well

### Practice Drills

**Drill 1: Target Practice** (Solo, 10 min)
- Place cones in service box corners
- 10 serves to each corner
- **Goal:** 70% accuracy

**Drill 2: Depth Control** (Solo, 10 min)
- Serve aiming for back wall bounce
- Want ball to hit back wall after service box bounce
- **Goal:** Deep, consistent serves

**Drill 3: Pressure Serves** (With partner, 10 min)
- Practice second serves specifically
- Imagine you're down match point
- **Goal:** Consistency under pressure

### Equipment for Better Serves

**Racket:** Round or teardrop shape (control > power for serves)  
**Balls:** Fresh balls (better bounce)  
**Shoes:** Good base (stable platform for serve motion)

**See:** [Equipment Guide](/equipment) for racket recommendations

# GUIDE 2: Net Positioning - Dominate the Front Court

**URL:** `/blog/net-positioning-guide`  
**SEO:** "Padel net position," "how to play net in padel," "net strategy padel"  
**Word Count:** 1,900 words

## Net Positioning: The Key to Winning in Padel

### Why Net Position Wins

**The golden rule of padel:** The team at net wins 70-80% of points.

**Why net is dominant:**
- ✅ **Hit balls earlier** (less time for opponents to react)
- ✅ **Volley opportunities** (end points quickly)
- ✅ **Force opponents to hit up** (you can smash down)
- ✅ **Control tempo** of the rally

**Baseline players lose.** It's that simple. Master getting to—and staying at—net.

### How to Achieve Net Position

**Step 1: Start from Baseline** (after serve/return)
- First shot: Deep and controlled
- **Goal:** Push opponents back

**Step 2: Move Forward Together** (with partner)
- Both players move up simultaneously
- **Key:** Move as a unit (synchronized)
- Maintain formation

**Step 3: Establish Position** (1-2 meters from net)
- Both at net = dominant
- **Don't overcommit:** Too close = lob vulnerability

**Step 4: Maintain Position**
- Only retreat for lobs
- **Otherwise:** Stay planted at net

### Proper Net Positioning

**Distance from net:**
- **Optimal:** 1-2 meters (3-6 feet)
- **Too close:** <1 meter (vulnerable to lobs, feet shots)
- **Too far:** >3 meters (not truly "at net")

**Lateral positioning:**
- **Cover your side** (drive or revés)
- Slight bias to middle (most balls go there)
- **Gap between partners:** 2-3 meters maximum

**Height ready position:**
- **Racket up** (chest height)
- Knees slightly bent
- **Weight on toes** (ready to react)

### Volley Technique at Net

**Key principles:**
1. **Short backswing** (compact motion)
2. Firm wrist (no floppiness)
3. **Contact in front** of body
4. Aim placement > power
5. **Quick recovery** (back to ready position)

**Types of volleys:**
- High volley (above shoulder) - put away or maintain pressure
- **Mid volley** (chest height) - most common
- Low volley (below waist) - lift gently, reset
- **Reflex volley** (close range) - block it back

### Common Net Position Mistakes

❌ **Standing too far back** (negates advantage)  
✅ **Fix:** Get closer! 1-2 meters is ideal

❌ **Partners at different depths** (creates gap)  
✅ **Fix:** Move together, stay parallel

❌ **Retreating unnecessarily** (giving up position)  
✅ **Fix:** Only back up for lobs, otherwise hold

❌ **Racket down** (not ready)  
✅ **Fix:** Racket always chest-high at net

❌ **Watching partner instead of ball** (lose focus)  
✅ **Fix:** Eyes on ball, trust partner

### Practice Drills

**Drill 1: Net Reaction** (15 min, need feeder)
- Stand at net
- Partner feeds balls from baseline
- **Goal:** Quick volleys, placement
- Progress: Increase feed speed

**Drill 2: Transition Practice** (15 min, full game)
- Start at baseline
- Hit approach shot, move up
- **Goal:** Establish net position within 3 shots
- Partner tries to push you back with lobs

**Drill 3: Net Hold** (10 min, competitive)
- Both teams start at net
- First team forced back loses point
- **Goal:** Maintain net dominance

### When to Abandon Net Position

**Only retreat for:**
- ✅ **Good lob** (over your head, can't reach)
- ✅ **Bajada de pared** (ball goes over fence)

**DON'T retreat for:**
- ❌ Hard shot at you (block it!)
- ❌ Low ball (bend down, volley it)
- ❌ Fear (trust your position)

### The Mental Game

**Confidence at net:**
- You SHOULD be at net (it's the dominant position)
- **Don't feel "exposed"** (you have the advantage)
- Trust your volleys
- **Commit** to the position

**Partner communication:**
- "Stay up!" (when partner wants to retreat unnecessarily)
- **"Switch!"** (when changing positions)
- "I've got middle" (covering center)
