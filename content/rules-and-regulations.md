# Padel Rules & Regulations: The Official Guide

## Master the Rules, Master the Game

Padel might look simple (hit ball over net, don't let it bounce twice), but the walls add delightful complexity. Here's everything you need to know about official padel rules—from serving to scoring to what happens when the ball escapes the court.

**The good news?** These rules are standardized by the **International Padel Federation (FIP)**, so whether you're playing in Miami or Madrid, the game stays the same.

## Scoring System

### Point by Point

Padel uses **tennis scoring:**

| Points Won | Score Name |
|------------|------------|
| 0 | Love (0) |
| 1 | Fifteen (15) |
| 2 | Thirty (30) |
| 3 | Forty (40) |
| 4 | Game (if ahead by 2) |

**At Deuce (40-40):**
- Called "deuce" or "40-all"
- Must win by **2 consecutive points**
- Advantage in → opponent wins next → back to deuce
- Advantage in → you win next → you win game

### Games, Sets, Matches

**Games:**
- First to 6 games wins the set
- Must win by 2 games
- At 6-6 → **tiebreak**

**Tiebreak:**
- First to **7 points** (win by 2)
- Server alternates every 2 points
- Switch sides at 4 points (or 8, 12, etc.)

**Sets:**
- Match formats vary:
  - **Best of 3 sets** (most common)
  - **Best of 5 sets** (tournaments)
  - **Single set to 6** (social play)

**Match Formats:**
- Social/recreational: Often 1 set or best of 3
- Tournament: Best of 3 sets
- Professional: Best of 3 or 5 sets

## In-Play Rules: What's Legal & What's Not

### Ball in Play

✅ **LEGAL:**
- Ball bounces on ground → hits your wall → you return it
- Ball bounces in opponent's court → comes back over net → you can hit it
- Ball bounces out of court → you can run around and play it (if you can reach it)
- Hitting ball on the volley (before it bounces)
- Your body touching the wall during play
- Ball touching the net on the way over (as long as it lands legally)

❌ **ILLEGAL (Point to Opponent):**
- Ball bounces twice on your side
- Ball hits wall before bouncing on ground (on serve or return)
- Ball hits ceiling/lights
- Ball goes directly out of court without bouncing
- You touch the net with racket or body
- You hit ball into the net
- Ball lands outside opponent's court
- You or racket crosses the plane of the net before hitting ball
- You hit ball twice (double-hit)
- Your partner hits ball after you do (two players can't hit consecutively)

### The Wall Rules (This Is Where It Gets Interesting)

**After the Bounce:**
Once the ball bounces in your court, it can:
- Hit the wall(s) any number of times
- You can hit it after it comes off the wall
- You can hit it before it hits the wall

**Direct Shots:**
- You can hit ball directly into your own wall before it crosses net
- **But:** This is risky and usually not a good strategy
- **Legal:** Yes. **Smart:** Rarely.

**Over the Fence:**
If opponent's shot bounces in your court and goes over the side fence:
- You can run around the court and hit it
- Must be before it bounces a second time
- This is called a **"bajada de pared"** or wall exit
- **Spectator favorite:** These points are exciting!

---

## Service Return Rules

**The Receiver Must:**
1. Let serve bounce once
2. Hit it back over the net
3. Cannot volley the serve (must let it bounce)

**After the Serve:**
- Any shots are fair game
- Volleys allowed
- Walls can be used normally

---

## Net Play Rules

### The Net is Sacred

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Touch the net with racket, body, or clothing
- Cross the plane of the net before hitting ball
- Reach over net to hit ball on opponent's side

✅ **You CAN:**
- Get very close to the net (no "kitchen" rule like pickleball)
- Follow through over the net after hitting ball on your side
- Touch your own side wall

### Volley Rules

✅ **Volleys Allowed:**
- After the serve is returned
- As much as you want
- From anywhere on court (including service box)

❌ **Volleys NOT Allowed:**
- Returning the serve (must bounce first)
- On your own serve (obviously)

---

## Let vs. Fault: What's the Difference?

### Let (Replay the Point)

Situations where you replay the point:
- **Serve hits net** and lands in correct service box
- **External interference** (ball from another court rolls in)
- **Unclear if ball was in/out** (and no referee/agreement)

**Important:** Unlike tennis, there's **no limit** on service lets. You can hit the net 10 times in a row—each is a let.

### Fault (Point Lost)

First serve fault → Second serve
Second serve fault → Point to opponent

Common faults:
- Serve doesn't land in service box
- Foot fault on serve
- Ball hits wall before bounce
- Ball hits ceiling/permanent fixtures

---

## Out of Bounds: When Points End

### The Ball is OUT When:

❌ **It bounces outside the court** (without bouncing inside first)
❌ **It hits the ceiling or lights**
❌ **It goes over the back wall** without bouncing
❌ **It hits permanent fixtures** (roof, overhanging structure)

### The Ball is IN When:

✅ **It bounces inside the lines** (lines are IN)
✅ **It hits the walls** after bouncing in court
✅ **It goes out after bouncing** in opponent's court (their problem now!)

**The Tricky Part:**
If ball bounces in your court → hits wall → bounces again in your court before you hit it = **point over** (two bounces)

---

## Doubles Rules & Etiquette

### Official Rules

**Both Players Can:**
- Hit the ball (but not consecutively)
- Stand anywhere on their side
- Move freely within their court area

**Switching Positions:**
- Partners can switch sides of court
- Communication is key ("I've got left side")
- Common after lobs or defensive situations

### Unwritten Etiquette Rules

**1. Communicate**
- Call "Mine!" when taking the ball
- Say "Yours!" to your partner
- Warn "Bounce!" if ball might go out

**2. Apologize for Net Cords**
- Lucky net shots that drop = apologize
- Shows good sportsmanship
- Even though it's legal

**3. Don't Poach Every Ball**
- Let your partner play too
- Trust them on their side
- **Exception:** If they clearly can't reach it

**4. Shake Hands/Fist Bump**

- This isn't tennis-level formal, but respect matters

**5. Control Your Celebrations**
- Celebrate big points (it's fun!)
- But read the room (don't overdo it in social play)
- Save the chest bumps for tournaments

---

## Time Rules (Usually Relaxed in Social Play)

### Official Tournament Timing

**Between Points:**
- Maximum **20 seconds** between points
- Includes time to get ball, prepare, serve

**Between Games:**

- Can sit, hydrate, strategize

**Warm-Up:**
- **5 minutes** before match

### Social Play Reality

Most clubs are relaxed about timing for casual games:

## Equipment Regulations

### The Racket (Pala)

**Official Specs:**

## Special Situations & Advanced Rules

### Golden Point (Punto de Oro)

Some leagues use "Golden Point" at deuce:
- At 40-40 (deuce), **next point wins the game**
- Receiving team chooses which side to receive
- **Faster format:** Prevents endless deuce situations

Not universal—check with your club/tournament.

### Ball Hits Player

**If ball hits you:**
- Point to **opponent** (you lost it)
- Doesn't matter if intentional or accidental
- Includes ball hitting racket while in your hand

**If you hit ball at opponent intentionally:**
- Legal (part of strategy)
- But hitting them when they're not playing ball = poor form

### Multiple Balls on Court

**If ball from another court enters:**
- **Call "Let!"** immediately
- Replay the point
- No penalty to either team

**Your ball goes to another court:**
- Apologize (universal courtesy)
- Wait for their point to finish before retrieving

### When Ball Breaks

**If ball breaks during point:**
- Point is replayed
- Replace with new ball
- No penalty

**If racket breaks:**
- Too bad, play with broken racket or concede point
- Can replace between points

---

## Tournament vs. Social Play

### Tournament Rules (Strict)

- **Time violations** enforced
- **Coaching prohibited** during play
- **Line judges** or referee make calls
- **Official balls** used
- **Dress code** may apply
- **Substitutions** not allowed

### Social/Recreational (Relaxed)

- **Honor system** for in/out calls
- **Friendly disagreement = replay point**
- **Reasonable breaks** between games
- **Coaching allowed** (usually encouraged!)
- **Mix and match** skill levels

---

## Making Calls: In or Out?

### The Honor System

In most social play:
- **Your side = you call it**
- If you're **not sure → call it in favor of opponent**
- If **genuinely unclear → replay the point**
- **Don't argue** (it's not worth it)

### Line Calls

**The Line is IN:**
- If any part of ball touches the line = **GOOD**
- This includes serve landing on service box line

**How to Tell:**
- Watch where ball lands, not where it bounces next
- Low perspective is better than high
- **When in doubt:** Give benefit of doubt to opponent

### Wall Calls

**Did it hit the wall before bouncing?**
- Usually obvious (sound + trajectory)
- If not sure = ask opponent "Did that hit wall first?"
- Honor system prevails

---

## Padel Etiquette: The Unwritten Rules

### On-Court Manners

**DO:**
- ✅ Shake hands/fist bump before and after
- ✅ Call score clearly before serving
- ✅ Return balls to opponents directly (don't make them chase)
- ✅ Apologize for lucky net shots
- ✅ Compliment good shots (even opponent's)
- ✅ Help retrieve balls from other courts

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Argue calls endlessly
- ❌ Throw racket (ever)
- ❌ Blame partner (seriously, don't)
- ❌ Coach from the sidelines in tournaments
- ❌ Walk behind courts during others' points
- ❌ Be *that* person who thinks they're at Wimbledon

### Between Points

- Return balls promptly
- Stay ready (but not rushed)
- Keep the game flowing
- **Social play tip:** Chat between games! It's part of the fun

### Court Sharing

Most clubs book courts for 90-minute slots:
- **Start on time** (don't leave courts empty)
- **End on time** (others are waiting)
- **Clean up** (take your water bottles, towels, trash)
- **Report issues** (broken glass, court damage) to club staff

## Common Rule Questions & Scenarios

### "Can I hit the ball before it bounces?"

**YES!** Volleys are allowed (and encouraged) after the serve is returned. The net is prime real estate in padel.

### "Can the ball hit the wall on my side before I hit it?"

**YES!** After it bounces on the ground. Common sequence:
1. Ball bounces in your court
2. Ball hits your back wall
3. You hit it back

This is **legal and strategic.**

### "Can I hit the ball into my own wall before it goes over the net?"

**YES, but...** it's risky. Ball must still go over net and land in opponent's court. Usually not the best play.

### "What if the ball goes over the wall after bouncing in their court?"

**You win the point!** If your shot bounces in opponent's court and has so much spin/angle it goes out = point for you (they couldn't return it).

### "Can I touch the wall?"

**YES!** You can lean on it, touch it, whatever. Just **don't touch the net.**

### "What if my racket flies out of my hand and hits the ball?"

**Point to opponent.** This is why the wrist strap is mandatory in tournaments—keeps racket attached to you.

### "Can we switch sides of the court?"

**YES!** Partners can switch positions during points or between points. Common after lobs or defensive situations.

### "What happens if ball hits the lights/ceiling?"

**Point to opponent.** Ceiling and permanent fixtures are out of bounds.

### "Do I have to wear the wrist strap?"

**Tournaments:** Usually yes (safety + rules)
**Social play:** Many clubs require it (insurance reasons)
**Our advice:** Wear it. Nobody wants a flying racket.

## Advanced Rules for Competitive Players

### The Let Serve Rule

Unlike tennis, there's **no limit** on service lets:
- Ball can hit net 100 times
- As long as it lands in service box = let (replay)
- This almost never happens, but theoretically...

### Ball Touches Net During Rally

**If ball touches net and goes over:**
- Play continues normally
- Totally legal
- No let called

Only on the **serve** does hitting the net trigger a let.

### Calling Foot Faults

**Who calls it:**
- **Opponent** can call foot faults
- **Receiver** typically calls them
- **In tournaments:** Line judge calls them

**What to do if called:**
- Accept it gracefully
- It's first serve → second serve
- Don't argue (it's low-class)

### Playing the Ball "Around the Net Post"

**Legal!** If ball goes wide and you hit it around the outside of the net post (not over net), it's legal **IF:**
- Ball landed in your court first
- Your shot lands in opponent's court
- Shot goes around (not over) the net

**Rare but spectacular** when it happens.

## Referee Signals & Tournament Protocol

### Common Referee Calls

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Point finger up | Point to server/team |
| Crossed arms at chest | Fault/violation |
| Rolling hand gesture | Time warning |
| Both hands out | Let/replay point |

### Challenging Calls

**Most U.S. clubs don't have:**
- Video review
- Hawk-Eye technology
- Line judges for every match

**What you DO have:**
- Your eyes
- Opponent's honesty  
- "Gentleman's call" tradition
- **When disputed:** Replay the point

---

## Adaptations & Variations

### Golden Point Format

Used in some leagues/tournaments:
- At 40-40 (deuce) → **next point wins**
- Receiving team chooses serve direction
- Speeds up matches significantly

### Short Sets

Social play might use:
- **First to 4 games** (instead of 6)
- **8-game pro set** (like tennis)
- **Timed matches** (60 or 90 minutes)

Check with your club!

### Mixed Doubles Modifications

Some social leagues:
- Alternate serves (male/female)

## Remember: Rules Are Guidelines, Fun Is Mandatory

Yes, these are the official rules. But here's the secret: **most recreational padel is pretty casual.** 

Unless you're in a tournament:
- Nobody's timing your 20 seconds between points
- Disagreements are solved with "Let's just replay it"
- The goal is to have fun and get a good workout

**Master the basics, learn as you play, and don't stress the details.**

The walls, the glass, the angles—padel has enough to think about. Focus on keeping the ball in play and having a great time.

**See you on the court!** 🎾
