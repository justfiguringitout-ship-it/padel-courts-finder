## 🎯 Your 30-Day Padel Roadmap

**Follow this plan and you'll go from "What's padel?" to "When's our next game?" in one month.**

### ☑️ WEEK 1: DISCOVER
**Time investment: 2 hours total**

- [ ] **Watch this 5-minute intro video** (understand the basics)
  
  [EMBED: YouTube video - "What is Padel?" by RSPA or similar]
  *Keep video embedded on page - autoplay disabled, controls enabled*

- [ ] **Read "[How to Play Padel](/how-to-play)"** (5-10 minutes)
  
  Quick version: It's tennis meets squash on a smaller court with glass walls you can use. Always played in doubles. Easier to learn than tennis. Ridiculously fun.

- [ ] **Find clubs near you** (5 minutes)
  
  Use our [court directory](/search) to locate facilities within 30 minutes of home. Look for:
  - "Offers beginner clinics" ✅
  - "Equipment rentals" ✅
  - "Drop-in friendly" ✅

- [ ] **Book your first clinic** (10 minutes)
  
  [Find Free Beginner Clinics Near You](/get-started/find-a-clinic)
  
  Most clubs offer FREE or $20-40 intro sessions. Don't skip this—30 minutes with a coach saves you hours of confusion.

**Week 1 Goal:** Scheduled and ready for your first session

---

### ☑️ WEEK 2: EXPERIENCE
**Time investment: 2-3 hours total**

- [ ] **Attend beginner clinic** (60 minutes)
  
  What to bring:
  - ✅ Court shoes (tennis/athletic, non-marking soles)
  - ✅ Athletic clothes (shorts, moisture-wicking shirt)
  - ✅ Water bottle
  - ✅ Positive attitude
  
  What NOT to bring:
  - ❌ Racket (rent at club for $5-15)
  - ❌ Stress (it's just a game!)
  - ❌ Expectations of being good (nobody is at first)

- [ ] **Play your first game** (90 minutes)
  
  Book a court with friends or join drop-in play. Yes, you'll be terrible. Yes, you'll have fun anyway.
  
  **Realistic first game:** You'll miss serves, hit the back wall with your racket, forget the score, and laugh a lot. This is normal and good.

- [ ] **Join club's WhatsApp group**
  
  Almost every club has one. This is how you find playing partners, ask questions, and become part of the community.

- [ ] **Learn basic terms** 
  
  Check out our [padel glossary](/get-started/glossary) for common words you'll hear:
  - **Bandeja** - overhead defensive shot
  - **Víbora** - overhead with spin
  - **Pala** - the racket
  - **Deuce** - 40-40 (like tennis)

**Week 2 Goal:** You've actually played padel and didn't die

---

### ☑️ WEEK 3: PRACTICE
**Time investment: 4-6 hours total**

- [ ] **Play 2-3 more games** (different clubs if possible)
  
  Try different courts:
  - Indoor vs outdoor (different feel)
  - Different clubs (find your favorite vibe)
  - Different partners (play with various skill levels)

- [ ] **Rent different rackets** (try before you buy)
  
  Most clubs have 3-5 rental options. Try:
  - Round shape (easiest, most forgiving)
  - Teardrop shape (balanced)
  - Different weights
  
  **Don't buy yet!** You don't know your style after 3 games.

- [ ] **Watch one pro match** (20 minutes)
  
  YouTube search: "Premier Padel highlights" or "World Padel Tour"
  
  **What to watch for:**
  - How they use walls (you'll start copying this)
  - Net positioning (both players move together)
  - Shot variety (it's not all smashing)

- [ ] **Identify your playing style preferences**
  
  Starting to notice:
  - Do you like being at net or baseline?
  - Aggressive or defensive?
  - Powerful shots or strategic placement?
  
  **It's okay if you don't know yet.** This develops over time.

**Week 3 Goal:** Comfortable on court, walls feel less weird

---

### ☑️ WEEK 4: COMMIT
**Time investment: 2-4 hours + decision**

- [ ] **Calculate your costs**
  
  Use our [cost calculator](/get-started/cost-calculator) to see:
  - Pay-per-play cost (if you'll play 1-2x/month)
  - Membership value (if you'll play 2+x/week)
  - Equipment investment needed
  
  **Most common:** $150-250/month for regular play (2x/week)

- [ ] **Make your decision: Casual or Regular?**
  
  **CASUAL PATH** (1-2x/month):
  - Keep renting equipment
  - Pay per session
  - Join drop-in games
  - **Low commitment, still fun**
  
  **REGULAR PATH** (1+x/week):
  - Get membership (saves money after ~6 sessions/month)
  - Buy basic equipment ($150-300)
  - Join league or regular group
  - **You're officially a padel player**

- [ ] **Buy equipment** (if going regular)
  
  Starter setup ($150-300):
  - Beginner racket: $80-120 ([see equipment guide](/equipment))
  - Court shoes: $70-100
  - Balls: $20 (case)
  - Bag: $30-50 (or use gym bag)
  
  **Check out:** [Equipment Guide for Beginners](/equipment#beginner-equipment)

- [ ] **Join a league or regular group**
  
  Most clubs have:
  - Weekly americano nights (show up solo, get paired)
  - Beginner leagues (organized play)
  - WhatsApp groups (self-organized games)

**Week 4 Goal:** You're now a padel player! 🎉

## ❓ YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

**[ACCORDION FAQ SECTION - Click to expand]**

### "I'm not athletic. Can I still play?"

**Absolutely!** Padel is less about raw athleticism and more about strategy, placement, and teamwork.

**Why non-athletes succeed:**
- Smaller court = less running than tennis
- Strategy matters more than power
- Walls give you more time to react
- **Doubles format** = partner helps carry the load

We've documented players in their 70s and 80s playing regularly. If they can do it, you can too.

---

### "I've never played any racket sport. Will I be lost?"

**Actually, you have an advantage!** No bad habits to unlearn.

**What beginners discover:**
- First 30 minutes: "This is confusing but fun"
- First 3 games: "Oh, I'm starting to get it"
- First month: "Wait, I'm actually decent at this"

Most people can rally and play a fun game **within their first session.** The learning curve is friendly.

---

### "Do I need to find 3 other people?"

**Nope!** This is the beauty of padel:

**Ways to play solo:**
- ✅ **Drop-in sessions** - Club pairs you with others
- ✅ **WhatsApp groups** - Every club has one, post your availability
- ✅ **Open play** - Show up alone, get matched by skill level
- ✅ **Lessons** - Coach + you counts as playing

**Over 85% of clubs** in our directory offer drop-in play. You can literally show up alone and play within 15 minutes.

---

### "What if I'm terrible?"

**Perfect!** Everyone is terrible at first.

**Reality check:**
- You'll miss serves (everyone does)
- You'll hit the back wall with your racket (we all have)
- You'll forget the score (totally normal)
- You'll have fun anyway (guaranteed)

**The padel community is incredibly welcoming** because the sport is growing. Everyone remembers being new. Players actively want to help you learn because growing the sport benefits everyone.

---

### "How long until I'm actually good?"

**Depends on your definition of "good":**

- ✅ **Can play and have fun:** 1-2 sessions
- ✅ **Can play competently:** 10-15 games (over 1-2 months)
- ✅ **Can compete in beginner tournaments:** 3-6 months (playing 2x/week)
- ✅ **Intermediate level:** 6-12 months
- ✅ **Advanced level:** 1-2 years

**Compare to other sports:**
- **Faster than:** Golf, tennis, squash
- **Similar to:** Pickleball
- **Slower than:** Beer pong (but more exercise)

[See detailed timeline →](/get-started/what-to-expect)

---

### "What's the difference between padel and pickleball?"

**Quick comparison:**

| Feature | Padel | Pickleball |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Court** | Enclosed with walls | Open, no walls |
| **Ball** | Pressurized (tennis-like) | Wiffle ball |
| **Walls** | Part of the game! | No walls |
| **Speed** | Faster, longer rallies | Slower, quick points |
| **Strategy** | More complex (3D with walls) | Simpler |
| **Social** | Extremely social | Very social |

**Which is better?** Neither! Both are fun. Many players do both.

**If you like strategy:** Padel (walls add dimension)  
**If you want simplest start:** Pickleball (no walls to learn)  
**If you can't decide:** Try both! Many clubs offer both sports.

---

### "Is it expensive?"

**Short answer: Not really.**

**Per-session cost:** $10-25/person for 90 minutes
- Split court rental among 4 players
- Cheaper than movies + dinner
- **Less than:** Golf, skiing, many gym classes

**Equipment:** $150-300 to start (if you play regularly)
- But you can **rent for months** before buying
- Many clubs have demo programs (try before you buy)

**Memberships:** Optional for casual play, worth it if playing 2+x/week

## 🎉 WELCOME TO PADEL

**You've made it this far. That means you're curious.**

**Here's what happens next:**

You'll read more guides. You'll watch videos. You'll calculate costs. You'll browse clubs. **And eventually, you'll book that first session.**

When you do, remember this moment. The curiosity. The "should I try it?" question.

Because three months from now, when you're explaining padel to *your* friends who've never heard of it, when you're showing them *this exact guide*, when you're the one saying "just try it, you'll love it"—you'll smile remembering that you were once here, at the beginning.

**Padel is waiting.**

**Your community is waiting.**

**Your first game is waiting.**

**525+ courts across America. One of them has your name on it.**
