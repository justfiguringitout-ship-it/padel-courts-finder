# How to Play Padel: The Complete Beginner's Guide

## What is Padel? (And Why You'll Be Addicted in 10 Minutes)

Imagine tennis and squash had a baby. Now put that baby on a smaller court surrounded by glass walls, hand it a solid racket with holes, and tell it the walls are in play. **That's padel.**

It's the **fastest-growing sport in the world** (yes, faster than pickleball), and once you play your first game, you'll understand why. It's:
- ✅ **Easy to learn** (you'll rally on day one)
- ✅ **Hard to master** (but incredibly fun trying)
- ✅ **Social by design** (always played in doubles)
- ✅ **Strategy over strength** (tactics win points, not just power)
- ✅ **Ridiculously addictive** (don't say we didn't warn you)

## The Basics: Padel in 60 Seconds

**The Court**
- Smaller than tennis (roughly 25% smaller)
- Enclosed by **glass walls** (back) and **metal mesh** (sides)
- Artificial turf or grass surface
- The walls are **part of the game** 🤯

**The Game**
- Always played in **doubles** (4 players total)
- Underhand serve (below waist, behind service line)
- Ball can bounce off walls after hitting the ground
- Score like tennis (15, 30, 40, game)
- **Win by:** Making the ball bounce twice on opponent's side

**The Vibe**
- More social than tennis (smaller court = more interaction)
- More strategic than pickleball (walls add complexity)
- Less intimidating than squash (easier to start)
- **Translation:** Perfect for literally everyone

## Understanding the Padel Court

### Court Dimensions & Layout

```
Official Padel Court Measurements:
- Length: 65.6 feet (20 meters)
- Width: 32.8 feet (10 meters)
- Total Area: About 2,150 sq ft

Key Zones:
- Service boxes (like tennis)
- No-volley line (3 meters from net)
- Back glass walls: 10-13 feet high
- Side mesh walls: 13 feet high
```

### The Walls Are Your Friend

This is what makes padel unique: **the ball stays in play when it hits the walls.** You can:
- Let it bounce off the back glass for a return
- Use side walls to create tricky angles
- Hit walls directly (after the bounce) for strategic shots

**Pro Tip:** In your first game, the walls will feel weird. By your third game, you'll be using them intentionally. By your tenth game, you'll wonder how tennis manages without them.

## How to Play: Step-by-Step

### Starting the Game

**1. The Serve** (This Is Different From Tennis)
- Stand **behind the service line** (not the baseline)
- Serve **underhand** (racket below waist at contact)
- Bounce the ball once, then hit it diagonally
- Ball must land in **opponent's service box**
- You get **two attempts** (like tennis)

**Serving Rules:**
- Server alternates sides (right/left) each point
- Partners alternate serving
- If the ball hits the net and lands in the correct service box, it's a **let** (serve again)

**2. The Rally Begins**
Once the serve is in:
- Hit the ball before it bounces twice
- You can let it bounce off the walls (after hitting the ground)
- Ball can touch the walls on your side before you hit it
- Volley allowed (except on the return of serve)

**3. Using the Walls**
Legal:
- ✅ Ball bounces on ground → hits wall → you hit it back
- ✅ You hit ball → it goes over net → bounces in their court (even if it then hits their wall)
- ✅ Ball bounces in their court → goes over the fence → you can run around and hit it back (yes, really!)

Illegal:
- ❌ Ball hits wall before bouncing on ground (point to opponent)
- ❌ You hit ball directly into wall before it crosses net
- ❌ Ball bounces twice before you hit it

### Scoring (Just Like Tennis)

Points: **0, 15, 30, 40, Game**
- Win by 2 points at deuce (40-40)
- Games: First to 6 games wins the set (must win by 2)
- Sets: Best of 3 or 5 sets (varies by tournament)
- Tiebreak at 6-6 (first to 7 points, win by 2)

**Why it's better than tennis scoring:** It's not. It's exactly the same. If you know tennis scoring, you're already halfway there!

## Basic Shots & Techniques

### Essential Shots for Beginners

**1. The Serve (Underhand)**
- Drop the ball, let it bounce
- Contact below waist height
- Aim diagonally to opponent's service box
- **Beginner tip:** Focus on consistency over power

**2. The Forehand**
- Your bread-and-butter shot
- Contact ball at waist height when possible
- Use walls for positioning
- **Key:** Watch the ball, not your opponent

**3. The Backhand**
- Two-handed is totally fine (even preferred for beginners)
- Use it when ball is on your non-dominant side
- **Secret:** Many pros use two-handed backhands

**4. The Volley**
- Hitting ball before it bounces
- Stay near the net for control
- Quick, compact swings
- **Most important shot** in padel (really!)

**5. The Lob**
- High, arcing shot over opponents' heads
- Lands deep in their court
- Buys you time to reposition
- **Use when:** You're in trouble

### Intermediate Shots (Once You've Got the Basics)

**The Bandeja** (Overhead defensive shot)
- Sliced overhead that stays in play
- Keeps opponents back
- Doesn't go out like a hard smash might

**The Víbora** (Spinning overhead)
- Overhead with side spin
- Hits side wall at angle
- Makes returns difficult

**The Chiquita** (Soft drop shot at net)
- Low, soft shot that barely clears net
- Drops at opponents' feet
- Forces them to hit up

**The Smash** (Winner!)
- Hard overhead to finish point
- Aim for gaps or at player
- **Risk:** Can go out or off wall incorrectly

## Strategy & Positioning

### The Golden Rules

**1. Start at the Baseline, Move to the Net**
- Serve/return from back
- Work your way forward as rally develops
- **Goal:** Both partners at net = best position

**2. Move Together**
- Stay **together** as a team (synchronized movement)
- If partner moves left, you move left
- **Imagine:** You're connected by a rope

**3. Control the Net**
- Team at net usually wins the point
- Force opponents back with lobs and deep shots
- Move up when you have advantage

**4. Use the Walls Strategically**
- Back wall bounce = more time to position
- Side walls = create angles
- **Practice:** Letting ball come off wall feels weird at first, then magical

### Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ **Staying at the baseline too long**
→ Move up! The net is where points are won

❌ **Trying to hit winners on every shot**
→ Consistency beats power in padel

❌ **Forgetting about partner**
→ Communicate! "Mine!" "Yours!" "Switch!"

❌ **Ignoring the walls**
→ Use them! They're your 5th and 6th teammates

❌ **Serving too hard**
→ Soft, consistent serves > aces (which are rare anyway)

## Different Formats & Game Types

## Tips for Absolute Beginners

### Before Your First Game

**1. Find a Beginner Clinic**
Most clubs offer free or low-cost intro sessions. Trust us, **30 minutes with a coach** saves you hours of confusion. Check our [directory](/search) for clubs near you offering beginner programs.

**2. Don't Buy Expensive Gear Yet**
Start with rentals! Every club rents rackets and provides balls. Try different styles before investing.

**3. Bring a Friend**
Padel is social. Grab a buddy who's also curious. You'll learn together and have someone to blame when you lose.

**4. Wear the Right Shoes**
Court shoes (tennis/padel specific) are important. Running shoes = sliding risk. See our [Equipment Guide](/equipment) for details.

### During Your First Game

**1. Stay Relaxed**
Everyone was a beginner once. Even the pros. (Okay, maybe not *that* relaxed, but close.)

**2. Focus on Consistency**
Just get the ball back over the net. Forget winners. Forget power. Just keep rallies going.

**3. Watch the Ball**
Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised. Eyes on ball = success.

**4. Communicate**
Say "Mine!" when you're taking the shot. Say "Yours!" when your partner should take it. Say "Sorry!" when you accidentally hit them with the ball (it happens).

**5. Have Fun**
It's a game. With walls. Where sometimes the ball bounces off glass at weird angles and everyone laughs. **Lean into it.**

## Common Questions New Players Ask

**"Is it like pickleball?"**
Some similarities (smaller than tennis, doubles focus), but padel has walls and uses a pressurized ball. It's faster, more strategic, and the rallies are longer.

**"Do I need to be fit?"**
Nope! Padel is less running than tennis. The smaller court means less sprinting. That said, you'll still work up a sweat.

**"Can older/younger players compete together?"**
Absolutely. Strategy and placement matter more than raw athleticism. Families play together all the time.

**"How long to get decent?"**
Most people can rally and play a fun game within 2-3 sessions. To get *good*? Like any sport, it depends on practice. But you'll have fun immediately.

**"Is it expensive?"**
Court rentals: $20-60/hour (split among 4 players = $5-15 each)
Memberships: $50-350/month (varies wildly)
Equipment: $50-200 to start

Compared to golf or skiing? Padel is downright affordable.

## The Padel Community Awaits

Here's the beautiful thing about padel: **the community is incredibly welcoming.** Because the sport is still growing in the U.S., everyone remembers being new. Players want to share it, teach it, and grow it.

Walk into any club and you'll find:
- Players willing to explain rules
- Drop-in sessions for solo players
- WhatsApp groups to find partners
- Friendly competition (emphasis on *friendly*)

From the "un-country club" vibe at Matt's Pickle & Padel in Pittsburgh to the luxury experience at Padel N9NE in San Diego, there's a club that matches your style.
