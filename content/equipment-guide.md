## Essential Equipment: What You Need to Play

### 1. The Padel Racket (Pala) üéæ

**The most important decision you'll make.**

#### For Your First 5-10 Games: RENT

Seriously. Every club rents rackets for $5-15. Try different shapes and weights before buying.

**Why?**
- You don't know your playing style yet
- Rackets range from $50 to $400+
- What feels good day 1 might not feel good day 30

#### When You're Ready to Buy: The Basics

**Racket Shapes (This Affects Everything):**

**Round (Redonda) - Best for Beginners**
- Largest sweet spot (forgiving on mishits)
- Best control
- Less power
- **Perfect for:** Learning the game, consistency players
- **Price:** $80-200

**Teardrop (L√°grima) - Intermediate Sweet Spot**
- Balanced power and control
- Medium sweet spot
- Versatile for different playing styles
- **Perfect for:** Players developing their game
- **Price:** $100-250

**Diamond (Diamante) - Advanced Power**
- Highest sweet spot on racket
- Maximum power
- Requires better technique
- **Perfect for:** Aggressive, experienced players
- **Price:** $150-400+

**Beginner recommendation:** Start with **round shape**. You'll thank us when you're actually hitting the ball instead of whiffing.

#### Weight Matters

**Light (340-360 grams / 12-12.7 oz)**
- Easier maneuverability
- Less fatigue
- Better for quick reactions at net
- **Best for:** Beginners, smaller players, defensive style

**Medium (360-375 grams / 12.7-13.2 oz)**
- Balanced control and power
- Most popular weight range
- Good all-around performance
- **Best for:** Intermediate players, most playing styles

**Heavy (375-390 grams / 13.2-13.8 oz)**
- More power on shots
- Better for smashes
- Requires more arm strength
- **Best for:** Advanced players, aggressive attackers

**New player sweet spot:** 360-370 grams (12.7-13 oz)

#### Materials & Construction

**Fiberglass/Glass Fiber**
- Softer feel
- More control
- Better comfort (less vibration)
- **Great for:** Beginners and control players
- **Downside:** Less power than carbon

**Carbon Fiber**
- Stiffer feel
- More power
- Longer durability
- **Great for:** Intermediate to advanced players
- **Downside:** Less forgiving on mishits

**Hybrid (Carbon + Fiberglass)**
- Best of both worlds
- Popular choice
- **Great for:** Most players

**Foam Core (Inside the Racket):**
- **EVA Foam:** Harder, more durable, consistent in temperature
- **FOAM (Soft):** Better shock absorption, comfortable
- **Both are good**‚Äîpersonal preference

#### Your First Racket: Our Recommendation

**Budget:** $80-120
**Shape:** Round (control/forgiveness)
**Weight:** 360-370 grams
**Material:** Fiberglass or hybrid
**Brands to Consider:** Wilson, HEAD, Babolat, Bullpadel, Nox, StarVie

**Where to Buy:**
- Your local club's pro shop (try before you buy!)
- Online retailers (but harder to test)
- Used marketplaces (Facebook groups, OfferUp)

---

### 2. Padel Balls üéæ

**Not tennis balls!** (Though they look similar)

#### The Difference

**Padel Balls:**
- **Lower pressure** than tennis balls
- Slightly softer compression
- Better for wall play and smaller court
- **Pressure:** 10.9-11.6 PSI (vs. tennis: 14 PSI)

**Tennis Balls:**
- Too lively for padel
- Bounce too high off walls
- Will annoy experienced players
- **Don't use them** (seriously)

#### Ball Types

**Pressurized (Most Common)**
- Used in most clubs and tournaments
- Last 3-5 games before losing pressure
- **Brands:** Wilson, Penn, Dunlop, Head, Bullpadel
- **Cost:** $5-10 per can (3 balls)

**Pressureless**
- Last longer (don't lose pressure)
- Feel different (heavier, less bouncy)
- **Use:** Practice, ball machines
- **Not ideal** for match play

#### How Many Balls?

**For Practice:** 1 can (3 balls) is fine
**For Matches:** 2 cans (6 balls) is ideal
**For Clinics:** Club usually provides

**Storage Tip:** Keep balls in pressurized can when not using. They'll last longer.

#### When to Replace Balls

Signs your balls are dead:
- ‚ùå Reduced bounce
- ‚ùå Softer feel when squeezed
- ‚ùå Fuzzy surface is worn smooth
- ‚ùå Lost their "pop" sound

**Most players replace balls every 3-4 games** for optimal play.

---

### 3. Court Shoes üëü

**This is non-negotiable. Wear proper court shoes.**

#### Why Court Shoes Matter

‚ùå **Running shoes:** Too much grip (ankle injuries on quick turns)
‚ùå **Cross-trainers:** Inconsistent traction
‚ùå **Tennis shoes (some):** Can work but not optimal
‚úÖ **Padel/Tennis court shoes:** Perfect grip, lateral support, non-marking

#### What Makes a Good Padel Shoe?

**Essential Features:**
- **Lateral support** (side-to-side movement)
- **Non-marking sole** (clubs require this)
- **Good traction** but not too much
- **Cushioning** for jumping and quick stops
- **Breathability** for long games

#### Padel-Specific Shoes vs. Tennis Shoes

**Padel Shoes:**
- Optimized for artificial turf
- More lateral stability (less forward running)
- Often have **herringbone pattern** sole
- **Best for:** Serious players

**Tennis Shoes (Court Specific):**
- Work well for padel
- Widely available in U.S.
- **Clay court tennis shoes** = great for padel
- **Hard court tennis shoes** = also work

**For Beginners:** Any **non-marking tennis or court shoe** works fine. As you advance, consider padel-specific.

#### Brands & Recommendations

**Padel-Specific Brands:**
- **Asics Gel-Padel** ($90-140)
- **Adidas Adipower** ($100-160)
- **Babolat Padel Shoes** ($80-150)
- **K-Swiss Aero** ($70-120)

**Tennis Shoes That Work:**
- Nike Court Zoom
- Asics Gel-Resolution
- Adidas Barricade
- New Balance FuelCell

**Budget:** $70-100 for quality shoes
**Premium:** $120-180 for top models

**Pro Tip:** Buy from club pro shops when possible‚Äîthey know what works on their courts.

### 4. Athletic Apparel & Accessories üëï

#### What to Wear

**Tops:**
- **Moisture-wicking shirts** (cotton gets heavy)
- **Tank tops** in summer
- **Long sleeves** for sun protection (outdoor courts)
- **Sports bras** for women (high-impact support)

**Bottoms:**
- **Athletic shorts** (with pockets for balls!)
- **Skirts/skorts** (popular in padel)
- **Leggings/athletic pants** (cooler weather)

**Style Points:** Padel fashion is having a moment. Many players dress like they're at a tennis club‚Äîand that's part of the fun.

#### The Wrist Strap (Mandatory in Tournaments)

**What it is:** Cord that attaches racket to your wrist

**Why you need it:**
- **Safety:** Prevents racket from flying
- **Rules:** Required in tournaments
- **Insurance:** Clubs often require it

**Cost:** Usually comes with racket ($0-10 separately)

#### Sweatbands & Headbands

**Wristbands:**

#### Your First Bag: Keep It Simple

**What you need:**
- **Racket compartment** (padded)
- **Space for balls, shoes, water**
- **Separate wet/dry pockets** (for sweaty clothes)

**Types:**

**Backpack Style ($30-80)**

## Equipment FAQs

**"Can I use a tennis racket?"**
No. Completely different design. Padel rackets are solid with holes, no strings.

**"Are expensive rackets worth it?"**
For beginners? No. After 6+ months of regular play? Maybe. After 1+ year? Probably yes if you're serious.

**"What's the difference between $100 and $300 rackets?"**
Materials (carbon vs. fiberglass), construction quality, power/control balance, durability. But honestly? A $120 racket plays great for most people.

**"Do I need padel-specific balls?"**
YES. Tennis balls don't work properly. The pressure difference matters.

**"Can I play in running shoes?"**
Technically yes, but you'll slip and risk ankle injuries. Just buy court shoes.

**"What brand do pros use?"**
Wilson, Babolat, Bullpadel, Adidas, HEAD, Nox, StarVie. But pros get free gear. You should buy what fits your budget and playing style.

**"How often should I replace my racket?"**
1-3 years depending on frequency. Signs to replace: visible cracks, frame damage, significant performance drop.
