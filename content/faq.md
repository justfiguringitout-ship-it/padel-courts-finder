## Basics & Getting Started

### What is padel?

Padel is a racket sport that combines elements of tennis and squash. It's played in doubles on an enclosed court about 25% smaller than a tennis court, with walls (glass and mesh) that are part of the game. Think of it as tennis meets squash meets "holy cow this is fun."

**Key features:**
- Always played in **doubles**
- Walls are **in play** (ball can bounce off them)
- **Underhand serves** only
- Scores like tennis
- Strategy over strength

### How do you pronounce it?

**"PAH-del"** (like "paddle" but with an "ah" sound)

Some say **"pah-DELL"** (Spanish pronunciation), but in the U.S., most people say PAH-del.

Either way works. What matters is getting on the court, not perfect pronunciation.

### Where did padel come from?

Padel was invented in **1969 in Acapulco, Mexico** by Enrique Corcuera. He built a smaller tennis court at his vacation home and added walls to keep balls from flying into his neighbor's yard.

**The sport exploded:**
- 1970s: Spread to Spain and Argentina
- 1990s-2000s: Became massive in Europe and Latin America
- **2020s:** Finally hitting the United States hard
- **Today:** 25+ million players in 110 countries

**Fun fact:** It's the #2 sport in Spain (after soccer) and the fastest-growing sport globally.

### Is padel hard to learn?

**Nope!** It's actually one of the easiest racket sports to pick up:

**Difficulty to start playing:**
- Padel: ⭐⭐ (Easy)
- Pickleball: ⭐ (Easiest)
- Tennis: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Squash: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Hard)

**Difficulty to master:**
- All of them: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very hard)

Most people can rally and have fun in their **first 30 minutes**. By game 3-4, you'll understand positioning and wall play.

### What age can start playing padel?

**Kids:** As young as 5-6 (with junior programs)
**Teens:** Perfect age—fast learners
**Adults:** Any age
**Seniors:** 60s, 70s, even 80s play regularly

**The beauty of padel:** Less running than tennis, more strategy than strength. Multi-generational play is common!

### Can I play padel alone?

**Technically:** Yes, singles padel exists (smaller court)
**Realistically:** Padel is designed for doubles

**If you're solo:**
- Join **drop-in sessions** (club pairs you with others)
- Use **WhatsApp groups** (most clubs have them)
- Sign up for **open play** (show up alone, get matched)
- Take **lessons** (coach + you)

**Over 90% of padel** is played in doubles. It's more fun that way!

## Rules & Gameplay

### How do you score in padel?

**Exactly like tennis:**
- Points: 0 (love), 15, 30, 40, game
- Deuce at 40-40 (must win by 2 points)
- First to 6 games wins the set (must win by 2 games)
- Tiebreak at 6-6 games
- Best of 3 or 5 sets

If you know tennis scoring, you're already set!

### Can the ball hit the wall?

**YES!** This is what makes padel unique:

**Legal wall play:**
- Ball bounces on ground → hits wall → you hit it back ✅
- Your shot bounces in opponent's court, then hits their wall ✅
- Ball bounces off wall multiple times before you hit it ✅

**Illegal:**
- Ball hits wall BEFORE bouncing on ground ❌
- Ball hits ceiling or lights ❌

### Do you serve underhand or overhand?

**Underhand ONLY.** This is a rule, not a suggestion.

**Proper serve:**
- Drop ball, let it bounce once
- Hit it **below waist height**
- Racket face **below wrist** at contact
- Aim diagonally to opponent's service box

**Why underhand?** Levels the playing field. Serve is about placement, not power.

### Can you volley in padel?

**Absolutely!** (Except when returning serve)

In fact, **volleys are the key to winning.** The team at the net usually dominates. Get comfortable volleying—it's the most important skill in padel.

### What happens if the ball goes out of the court?

**If ball bounces in your court and flies out over the fence:**
- You can **run around** and hit it back (before second bounce)
- This is legal and awesome to watch
- Called **"bajada de pared"** or wall exit
- **Crowd loves these points**

**If ball goes straight out without bouncing:**
- Point to opponent
- Ball is out of play

### How long is a typical padel game?

**Social match:** 45-90 minutes
**Tournament match:** 60-120 minutes
**Quick game:** 30-45 minutes (one set to 6)

**Factors:**
- Player skill (beginners = longer rallies = longer games)
- Format (1 set vs. best of 3)
- **Deuce games** (can extend things)

## Equipment & Gear

### What equipment do I need to play padel?

**Absolute essentials:**
1. **Padel racket** (not tennis racket!)
2. **Padel balls** (not tennis balls!)
3. **Court shoes** (non-marking)
4. **Athletic clothes**
5. **Water bottle**

**That's it!** Everything else is optional.

### Can I use a tennis racket?

**No.** Completely different equipment:

**Tennis racket:** Strings, long handle, oval head
**Padel racket:** Solid face with holes, short handle, perforated surface

They're not interchangeable. But the good news? Padel rackets start at $50 and clubs rent them for $5-15.

### How much does a padel racket cost?

**Beginner:** $50-120 (perfectly good)
**Intermediate:** $120-200 (better materials)
**Advanced:** $200-400+ (carbon fiber, pro models)

**Our recommendation:** Start with rentals or a $80-120 racket. Upgrade after 6 months if you're playing regularly.

### What's the difference between padel balls and tennis balls?

**Padel balls:**
- Lower pressure (10.9-11.6 PSI)
- Slightly smaller bounce
- Designed for wall play and smaller court

**Tennis balls:**
- Higher pressure (14 PSI)
- Bounce too much for padel
- Will annoy your opponents

**Can you use tennis balls in a pinch?** Emergency only. Buy proper padel balls ($5-10 per can).

### Do I need special shoes?

**YES.** This is important:

**✅ Court shoes:** Tennis, padel-specific, squash shoes
**✅ Non-marking soles:** Required by all clubs
**✅ Lateral support:** Prevent ankle injuries

**❌ Running shoes:** Too much forward grip, not enough lateral support
**❌ Basketball shoes:** Usually fine but overkill
**❌ Street shoes:** Club will kick you off court

**Investment:** $70-140 for quality court shoes. Your ankles will thank you.

**Padel's secret:** Low barrier to entry, high ceiling for mastery. You'll have fun immediately and can improve forever.

→ Get comfortable with wall play

## Padel vs. Other Sports

### How is padel different from pickleball?

**Biggest differences:**

| Feature | Padel | Pickleball |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Court** | Enclosed with walls | Open court, no walls |
| **Ball** | Pressurized (tennis-like) | Wiffle ball (plastic with holes) |
| **Racket** | Solid with holes, short handle | Solid paddle, short handle |
| **Serve** | Underhand, bounce first, diagonal | Underhand, diagonal, below waist |
| **Walls** | Part of the game! | No walls |
| **Speed** | Faster, longer rallies | Slower, quick volleys |
| **Strategy** | Complex (walls add dimension) | Simpler (kitchen zone strategy) |

**Which is better?** Neither! Both are fun. Padel is more strategic, pickleball is more accessible. Many clubs offer both!

### How is padel different from tennis?

**Key differences:**

| Feature | Padel | Tennis |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Court size** | 25% smaller | Full-size |
| **Walls** | Yes (glass + mesh) | No walls |
| **Players** | Always doubles | Singles or doubles |
| **Serve** | Underhand only | Overhand allowed |
| **Racket** | Solid, no strings | Strung racket |
| **Power** | Strategy over strength | Power matters more |

**Tennis players love padel** because it's familiar but fresh. The serve is easier, the court is smaller (less running), and the walls add a fun new dimension.

### How is padel different from platform tennis (paddle tennis)?

**They're DIFFERENT sports!** This confuses people:

**Platform Tennis (Paddle Tennis):**
- Played on elevated platform
- **Wire screens** around court (not glass)
- **Spongy rubber ball** (not pressurized)
- Popular in Northeast U.S.
- **Winter sport** (heated courts)

**Padel:**
- Ground-level court
- **Glass walls** and metal mesh
- **Pressurized ball** (like tennis)
- Global sport (110+ countries)
- **Year-round** play

**Don't get fooled:** 5 facilities in our original search were platform tennis, not padel. They're related but distinct sports.

### Is padel easier than tennis?

**To start:** YES
**To master:** NO

**Easier aspects:**
- Underhand serve (vs. tennis overhead)
- Smaller court (less running)
- Doubles focus (shared workload)
- Forgiving for beginners (walls help keep rallies going)

**Harder aspects:**
- Wall angles take practice
- 3D strategy (where will ball bounce off wall?)
- Net play is more important
- Reads and anticipation matter more

**Tennis players transitioning:** Usually good at padel within 5-10 games.

### Can tennis players play padel?

**Absolutely!** Tennis players often become great padel players quickly:

**Advantages you have:**
- Racket control
- Understanding of spin
- Court positioning instincts
- Scoring system (same)

**What you need to learn:**
- Underhand serving
- Wall angles and bounces
- Closer net play
- Relying on partner (if you play singles tennis)

**Estimated adjustment:** 3-5 games to feel comfortable, 10-15 games to play well.

## Unique Situations

### Can I build a padel court at home?

**Technically yes, but:**

**Space needed:**
- 46 ft × 82 ft minimum
- **Plus:** Clearance around court
- **Flat surface** required

**Cost:**
- **DIY approach:** $40,000-60,000

- **Permits:** Required in most areas

**Alternatives:**
- **Portable courts:** Exist but expensive ($30,000+)
- **Share with neighbors:** Split costs
- **Reality:** Joining a club is way cheaper

**Few people have home courts** in the U.S. (unlike in Spain where it's common).

### Is padel played in the Olympics?

**Not yet**, but there's a strong push:

**Current status:**
- **IOC recognition:** Working on it
- **Pan American Games:** Padel included (2023 Santiago)
- **European Games:** Featured sport

**Prediction:** Padel likely in Olympics by **2032 or 2036** if growth continues.

**Why it should be:** 
- Global participation (110+ countries)
- 25+ million players
- Exciting to watch

### What's "golden point" in padel?

- Receiving team chooses which side to receive
- **Speeds up matches** significantly

**Why clubs use it:**
- Prevents endless deuce games
- **Time management** for court bookings
- More action, less grinding

**Not universal:** Check your league/tournament format. Traditional deuce is still most common.

### Why do some clubs have "coming soon" for months?

**Welcome to permitting hell:**

**Reality of opening a club:**
- **Permits:** 3-12 months (sometimes longer)
- **Construction delays:** Supply chain, weather
- **Inspections:** Multiple rounds
- **Example:** Mesa Padel Club announced Fall 2025, actually opening December 2025

**Our directory notes:**

## Random But Important Questions

### Why do padel rackets have holes?

**Engineering reasons:**
- **Reduce air resistance** (faster swings)
- **Less weight** without sacrificing strength
- **Better aerodynamics**
- **Vibration dampening**

**Fun fact:** The holes are carefully designed. Count and placement affect the racket's performance!

### Can you play padel in the dark?

**With lights, yes!** Most courts have lighting:

**Outdoor courts:**
- LED lights (most common now)
- **Night play** very popular
- **Often cooler** than daytime

**Indoor courts:**
- Lit all the time (duh)
- Optimal lighting design

**Some clubs have amazing night vibes** with colorful LED lighting!

### What's "padbol"?

**Padel + Football (soccer) = Padbol**
- Played on padel court
- Use feet instead of racket
- **Rare in U.S.** but growing

**Where to find:** Eco's Sports Park (Puerto Rico) has padbol courts!

### Why is it called a "pala" not a "racket"?

**"Pala"** is Spanish for paddle/racket. Since padel originated in Spanish-speaking countries:
- Spain calls it "pala"
- Argentina calls it "paleta"
- **U.S. says:** Racket, paddle, pala (all accepted)

**Doesn't matter what you call it** as long as you're using it!

### Can you play padel on a tennis court?

**Kind of, but not really:**

**Improvised padel (for fun):**
- Use tennis court with portable walls
- **Temporary setups** exist
- Not the same experience

**Real answer:** No. Padel needs enclosed court with proper walls. The walls are fundamental to the game.

**Building proper court:** See our [equipment guide](/equipment) for court specifications.
