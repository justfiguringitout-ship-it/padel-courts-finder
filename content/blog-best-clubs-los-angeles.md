## #8. Additional LA-Area Clubs

### Padel Courts in Greater LA Metro

**Nearby Cities with Padel:**
- **Long Beach:** Potential locations

## ⚠️ PLATFORM TENNIS ALERT

### Venice Beach Paddle Tennis Courts - NOT PADEL!

**📍 Location:** Venice Beach, Los Angeles  
**⚠️ Important:** This is **PLATFORM TENNIS** (also called "paddle tennis"), **NOT PADEL**

**The difference:**
- **Platform tennis:** Wire screens, spongy ball, different sport (since 1962)
- **Padel:** Glass walls, pressurized ball (what we're talking about)

**Why the confusion:** 
- Both called "paddle" sports
- **Platform tennis** has been at Venice Beach since 1962
- It's fun! But it's not padel

**If you want padel in LA:** Check the clubs above.  
**If you want platform tennis:** Venice Beach has 3 free courts!
