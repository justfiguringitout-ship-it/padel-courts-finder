## DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS

### Pattern #1: Database Tends to Overestimate
- **68 clubs**: Google ratings HIGHER than database (we're underestimating)
- **19 clubs**: Google ratings LOWER than database (we're overestimating)
- **Net Effect**: Slight tendency to underestimate (good for credibility)

### Pattern #2: Perfect 5.0 Ratings Often Wrong
- Clubs with 5.0 in database frequently have lower Google ratings
- Example: Pura Padel, Park Padel Embarcadero, Reserve Solé Mia
- **Recommendation**: Be skeptical of perfect 5.0 ratings

### Pattern #3: New Clubs Have Volatile Ratings
- Clubs with <10 reviews often have ratings that change frequently
- Example: Mink Padel went from 4.4 → 5.0 as more reviews added
- **Recommendation**: Mark new clubs with "New!" and note review count

### Pattern #4: Membership Clubs Have Lower Public Ratings
- Reserve Padel NYC: 3.5 (lower than expected)
- Likely due to high prices, exclusivity complaints
- **Recommendation**: Note membership requirement in listings
