## 🎯 **The Answer: Listicles in Blog? YES**

**Structure it as:**
```
/blog/best-padel-clubs-miami (part of blog)
/blog/category/best-clubs (all listicles grouped)
```

**Not as:**
```
/rankings/miami (separate section - DON'T DO THIS)
/best-clubs/miami (separate from blog - DON'T DO THIS)
```

**Why?**
- ✅ SEO consolidation (blog authority grows)
- ✅ Simpler navigation (one blog, multiple categories)
- ✅ User expectation (people expect rankings in blogs)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (one publishing workflow)

**Make them discoverable:**
- Category page: `/blog/category/best-clubs`
- Homepage widget: "Popular Rankings"
- **Tag:** All listicles tagged "rankings" or "best-clubs"
- Filter: "Show only Best Clubs posts"

**Users can find them easily,** content stays organized, SEO value concentrates.
