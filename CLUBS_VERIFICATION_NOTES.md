## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

### Your Austin Blog Post Says:

**"Quick Rankings"**
- 🏆 Best Overall: Padel39 (6 courts + 12 coming, luxury amenities) ← **NOT IN DIRECTORY!**
- 💰 Best Value: Pick & Paddle ($12.50/person off-peak!)
- 🎓 Best for Beginners: **Padel Club Austin** ← **NOT IN DIRECTORY!**
- 🏅 Best Courts: Dripping Springs (first aluminum courts in U.S.)
- 🏆 Most Courts: Legacy Padel (13 courts coming Fall 2025)

**Your blog ranks clubs you don't list!** This is a credibility issue.

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Add Padel Club Austin** (mentioned as #1 for beginners)
2. **Add Padel39** (mentioned as #1 overall)
3. **Update blog to link to their detail pages**

**Timeline:** Do this TODAY before Google notices the discrepancy
