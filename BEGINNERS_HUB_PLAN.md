**Faster improvement if:**
- ✅ Play 2-3x/week (vs. 1x/week)
- ✅ Take lessons/clinics
- ✅ Play with better players
- ✅ Watch pro matches
- ✅ Previous racket sport experience

**Slower (but still fun!) if:**
- Playing 1x/month or less
- Only playing with same skill level
- Never taking instruction
- **Still enjoyable!** Just slower progression

### Purpose
Help beginners avoid frustration by identifying what everyone does wrong.

### Content (1,200 words)

**The 15 Mistakes Every Beginner Makes (And How to Fix Them)**

**1. Staying at the Baseline Forever**
- ❌ **The mistake:** Never moving up to net
- ✅ **Fix:** Move forward after good shots
- **Why:** Net position wins points in padel

**2. Trying to Hit Winners on Every Shot**
- ❌ **The mistake:** Going for smashes constantly
- ✅ **Fix:** Focus on consistency, build the point
- **Why:** Errors lose more points than winners win

**3. Ignoring Your Partner**
- ❌ **The mistake:** Playing like singles
- ✅ **Fix:** Communicate, move together, trust them
- **Why:** It's called doubles for a reason

**4. Serving Too Hard**
- ❌ **The mistake:** Trying to ace with serve
- ✅ **Fix:** Soft, consistent serves to start rally
- **Why:** Aces are rare; serve starts the point, doesn't win it

**5. Forgetting the Walls Exist**
- ❌ **The mistake:** Not letting ball come off wall
- ✅ **Fix:** Be patient, let ball bounce off wall to you
- **Why:** Walls give you more time and options

[Continue through #15...]
