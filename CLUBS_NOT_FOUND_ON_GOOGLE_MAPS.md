## Recommendations

### Short-term:
1. Monitor these clubs for Google Maps listings
2. Reach out to verify status if possible
3. Add "Coming Soon" badge to frontend for clubs without ratings

### Long-term:
1. Quarterly verification check for these facilities
2. Update ratings once they appear on Google Maps
3. Consider adding "verification_status" field to track this

## Notes

- All clubs retained per user directive - no deletions
- Coming soon facilities like Padel 956 are valid entries
- Rating field made optional in TypeScript to support this use case
- Future clubs should be verified before adding to database
